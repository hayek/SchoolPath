# PathSchool - Project Summary

## Overview

PathSchool is a complete mobile-first web application for creating and managing educational walking tours in Haifa, Israel. The system is designed for elementary and middle school students (grades 1-8) and provides an intuitive interface for teachers to create custom routes with educational content.

## What Has Been Built

### 🌐 Three Main Web Pages

1. **Main Landing Page** (`index.html`)
   - Displays all available trips on a unified map
   - Shows trip cards with details (title, description, date, grades)
   - Each trip rendered as a colored walking route on the map
   - Click any trip to view details

2. **Individual Trip Page** (`trip.html`)
   - Shows detailed trip information
   - Interactive map with the complete route
   - List of all points of interest with descriptions
   - Photos and external mission links for each POI
   - "Start Navigation" button that opens Google Maps with full walking directions

3. **Trip Creator Tool** (`creator.html`)
   - Interactive map interface for creating new trips
   - Add points of interest and routing waypoints by clicking on map
   - Drag-and-drop to reorder points
   - Edit POI details (name, description, photo, mission link)
   - Visual form for trip metadata (title, description, date, grades, color)
   - Export functionality to download JSON file

### 🎨 Design System

- **Apple-inspired minimalist UI** with clean, modern aesthetics
- **Mobile-first responsive design** that works seamlessly on all devices
- **Hebrew language support** with RTL (right-to-left) layout
- **Smooth animations and transitions** for better UX
- **Accessible color scheme** with proper contrast ratios
- **Touch-optimized** for mobile interactions

### 🗺️ Google Maps Integration

- **Interactive maps** on all pages
- **Custom styled markers** for POIs (color-coded to trips)
- **Polyline routes** showing the walking path
- **Info windows** with POI details
- **Drag-and-drop markers** in creator tool
- **Direct navigation** to Google Maps app with full route

### 📊 Data Architecture

- **JSON-based data storage** (no database required)
- **Modular trip files** - each trip is a separate JSON file
- **Index system** for trip discovery
- **Well-documented schema** (see DATA_STRUCTURE.md)
- **Flexible point system**:
  - Points of Interest (POIs) - main educational stops
  - Secondary Points - for precise route control

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation

**Frontend Stack:**
- Pure HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- No frameworks or build tools required
- Vanilla JS for simplicity and performance
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- CSS Variables for theming

**JavaScript Modules:**
- `index.js` - Main page logic
- `trip.js` - Individual trip logic
- `creator.js` - Trip creation logic
- `maps.js` - Reusable map utilities
- `load-maps.js` - Dynamic API loading

**Styling:**
- Single `styles.css` file
- Component-based class naming
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile/desktop
- Custom properties for easy theming
